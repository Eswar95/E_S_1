To push a local folder (which represents your project) to GitHub, follow these steps using the command line:
Initialize a Git repository in your local folder:
Navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal or command prompt and run:
Code



    git init
Add your project files to the staging area:
This command stages all files and folders in your current directory for the next commit:
Code


git add .
Commit the staged files.
Create a commit with a descriptive message:
Code


    git commit -m "Initial commit of my project"
Create a new repository on GitHub.
Go to GitHub, sign in, and create a new empty repository. Do not initialize it with a README or license at this stage, as you are pushing an existing local project. Copy the repository's URL. add the remote origin.
Link your local repository to the newly created GitHub repository by adding a remote origin. Replace <remote_repository_URL> with the URL you copied from GitHub.
Code



    git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>
Push your local branch to GitHub.
Push your local main (or master) branch to the origin remote. The -u flag sets the upstream branch, so future git push commands will be simpler.
Code



    git push -u origin main
(If your default branch is named master, use git push -u origin master instead.) Verify the push.
Refresh your GitHub repository page in your web browser. You should now see your project's files and folders uploaded to the repository.
